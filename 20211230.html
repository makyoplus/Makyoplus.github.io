	<h2>20211230: VR Home Environment</h2>
	
	<p class="bodyparagraph">
	I had the idea  during one of this year's many lockdowns to create a virtual environment that corresponds the physical layout of my actual lounge.<br><br>
	After loading into the home environment countless times before launching into other games (at the time of writing Steam tells me I've spent 597 hours in SteamVR)
	it seemed like a good idea to create my own space; <br><br>
	a customisable half-loungeroom, half-starting menu, to land in when I put on the headset.<br><br>
	I figured it would be a project where I could learn some beginners skills in modelling and using the specific tools involved,
	 and could be the foundation for further AR projects where the virtual and physical worlds should correspond.<br><br>

	In the end I didn't create a 1:1 VR model of my IRL lounge, but instead ended up creating a very simple room, with baked-in lighting and a skybox made from scratch.<br><br>

	I modelled the room in Blender, added some lighting, and created a procedural concrete/stone like texture for the surfaces.<br><br>

	For the skybox, I used in-built landscape and sky creation tools, and spent some time messing around with shader nodes to try and create another stone-like texture for the mountains.<br><br>

	In the interests of finishing the project in order to move on to others, I did not get too hung-up on creating realistic mountains or adding fog,
	and the result I ended up with seems like some kind of high-res version of a Doom skybox.<br><br>
	I rendered the skybox into 6 square images to correspond with the sides of a cube.<br><br>

	I then split the room into four separate models (to allow higher resolution of baked in textures), and baked lightmaps for each of them, and exported them as fbx files. <br><br>
	There was a little bit of setup required in order to have the model and texture image files in the correct format and location to work with the SteamVR tools.<br><br>

	I then imported everything into SteamVR workshop. There was some mix up with an inches to centimeters conversion somewhere along the way, and I had to rescale the model in the hammer editor.<br><br>
	After a bit more tinkering and adjustmenting, I compiled the environment and uploaded myself into it.<br><br>

	It is very rudimentary and leaves lots to be desired; particularly the skybox and lack of normal maps or specularity in the room textures.<br><br>
	In completing the project however I've learnt a bit about modelling generally, and also more specifically about using Blender and the SteamVR workshop tools. <br><br>
	The former was well documented and I found it easy to find solutions for problems I encountered due to the wealth of tutorials, forums and blogs available for Blender. <br><br>
	For SteamVR workshop tools however, the documentation was more sparse and I had to dig around more for information on peoples experiences, 
	find forum posts and videos with people using the old tools, and then use trial and error to fill in the gaps.<br><br><br><br>
	I find the prospect of modeling a virtual space on a 2D screen and then stepping into it and experiencing it as a 3D space an exciting one, particularly if we are able to share these spaces with other people.<br><br>
	With the VR metaverse emerging in its current myriad manifestations, I look forward to the tools enabling this to become more accessible.<br><br>

	I hope to build upon what I've learned with further iterations, including more detailed procedurally generated textures and surfaces, atmospheric effects etc.<br><br>
	I'd like to explore algorthmically generating meshes from scripts in Blender, to create more detailed terrain for use in the skybox or stone meshes.<br><br>
	Furthermore I hope to create some items/models to populate the space (maybe even try scanning real objects using OpenScan and bringing them into the virtual environment).<br><br><br><br>
