		<h1>NX-Deck</h1>

		<p>
		With the idea seeded by the Gameboy Pocket I shared with my siblings at age 5, growing up I became fascinated with the idea of a multipurpose, portable, handheld computer. Ideally such a system would be highly portable, customisable, with adequate processing power, suitable for accessing the web, consuming multimedia, gaming and coding, with a user interface and input scheme suitable for on-the-go use (i.e. more portable than a laptop), but with sufficient connectivity and accessibility to avoid too much compromise in usability. Such a device would be useful as a secondary computing device (alongside the phone) in scenarios such as "one-bag" travel, where a laptop would be too heavy and unpractical.<br><br>
		Whilst (as of early 2025) the winds of change seem to finally be blowing in a favourable manner in the the handheld computing space, commercial production units on offer so far have seemed to tend either towards the more powerful, larger units (pressing the limits of portability), or alternatively smaller devices with non-general purpose OS's limited to gaming and emulation functions (or android, which whilst some would argue can function as a general purpose OS, I find incredibly frustrating and limited to try and use this way).<br><br>
		Form-wise, the Nintendo Switch (from here on referred to as <b>NX</b>) would seem an ideal potential platform for such a device - however the NX's proprietary OS "Horizon" is very limited in functionality, and is far from general-purpose. This is despite the NX's hardware being perfectly capable of running a general purpose operating system.<br><br>
		Luckily, the NX is in fact perfectly capable of functioning as a general purpose handheld computer (and offering a means to prevent the NX from becoming e-waste when its commercial life-cycle is over). The first run of NXs contained an unpatchable vulnerability in the BootROM of the NX's Tegra X1 chip that allowed the user to run their own code and boot alternative software. Whilst the vulnerability was patched, modchips were devised to allow the same functionality with subsequently released units. This paved the way for the growth of a community ecosystem developing all manner of projects and functionality for the NX, some of which have attracted the attention (and legal scrutiny) of Nintendo themselves, sparking lively debate about software and hardware ownership and modification (note: <i>I do not in any way endorse or support software or videogame piracy.</i>).<br><br>
		Emergiong from this community is <a href="https://switchroot.org/">Switchroot</a>, a group "for open-source development on the Nintendo Switch, a Tegra X1-based game console with a FOSS bootstrap exploiting a low-level recovery bootloader." This group has developed and maintains projects allowing one to run various different Linux distributions on the NX.<br><br>
		Having distrohopped through a few of the projects I'm currently settled on L4T Fedora 39, and I've customised the UX experience to my preference:
		- Custom initramfs boot sequence images
		- Custom session manager theme
		- DWM windows manager
		- DWM status script
		- NX controller mapped to keystrokes
		- Custom key combos e.g. for onscreen keyboard (svkbd), to open terminal, resize/close windows, control volume/brightness, enable/disable wifi...
		What do I use it for/with it?
			- Firefox for browsing the web
			- vlc for watching videos
			- audacious for listening to music
			- Schismtracker for making music (using the onscreen keyboard is clunky, but it works...)
			- yt-dlp for youtube
			- emulators: ????
