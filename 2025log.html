		<h1>DS Project</h1>
		<p>
		Projects for the Nintendo DS, a 32bit handheld computer system released by Nintendo in 2004.
		DS; the initials more commonly understood to represent "dual system", but also known to designate "developer system", introducing innovative and experimental features, in addition to incremental improvements upon previous gaming systems. At the time of writing, the NDS remains the handheld game console that has sold the most units (154.02 million units), meaning they are low cost and easy to obtain parts for, and therefore a desirable option for modding and experimentation. The availability of flashcarts, and the creation and maintenance of development tools within the extensive development community also makes them an optimal system for developing software to leverage features built into the system (e.g. 3D engine, networking connectivity, dual processor, slot-2 expansion functionality).
Here I document explorations of a system that has, for me, prompted much imagining and reflection on what a handheld personal computer could be.
