		<h1>NX-Deck</h1>

		<p>
		Growing up I became fascinated with the idea of a multipurpose, portable, handheld computer. Ideally such a system would be highly portable, customisable, with adequate processing power, suitable for accessing the web, consuming multimedia, gaming and coding, with a user interface and input scheme suitable for on-the-go use (i.e. more portable than a laptop), but with sufficient connectivity and accessibility to avoid too much compromise in usability. Such a device would be useful as a primary computing device in such scenarios as minimalist travel, where a laptop might be too heavy or unwieldy.<br><br>
		As of now (early 2025) the space of handheld general computers (as gaming devices) is burgeoning, though offering have so far tended either towards the more powerful, larger units (pressing the limits of portability), or smaller devices with non-general purpose OS's limited to gaming and emulation functions (or android, which is a terrible OS for general use).<br><br>
		Form-wise, the Nintendo Switch (from here on referred to as <b>NX</b>) would seem a good potential platform for such a device - however the NX's proprietary OS "Horizon" is very limited in functionality, and is far from general-purpose. This is despite the NX's hardware being perfectly capable of running a general purpose operating system.<br><br>
		The NX is in fact entirely capable of functioning as a general purpose handheld computer (offering a means to prevent the NX from becoming e-waste when its commercial life-cycle is over). The first run of NXs contained an unpatchable vulnerability in the BootROM of the NX's Tegra X1 chip that allows the user to run non-offical software. Whilst the vulnerability was patched in later revisions, modchips were devised to allow the same functionality with subsequently released units. This has paved the way for the growth of a community ecosystem developing all manner of projects and functionality for the NX, some of which have attracted the attention of Nintendo themselves, sparking lively debate about software and hardware ownership and modification (<i>I do not in any way endorse or support software or videogame piracy.</i>).<br><br>
		Emerging from this community is <a href="https://switchroot.org/">Switchroot</a>, a group "for open-source development on the Nintendo Switch, a Tegra X1-based game console with a FOSS bootstrap exploiting a low-level recovery bootloader." This group has developed and maintains projects allowing one to run various different Linux distributions on the NX.<br><br>
		Having moved through a few of the projects I've currently settled on L4T Fedora 39, and I've customised the UX experience to my preference:<br>
		- Custom initramfs boot sequence images<br>
		- Alternate session manager theme<br>
		- DWM windows manager<br>
		- DWM status script<br>
		- NX controller mapped to keystrokes<br>
		- Custom key combos e.g. for onscreen keyboard (svkbd), to open terminal, resize/close windows, control volume/brightness, enable/disable wifi...<br><br>
		What do I use it for/with it?<br>
			- Firefox for browsing the web<br>
			- vlc for watching videos<br>
			- audacious for listening to music<br>
			- Schismtracker for making music (using the onscreen keyboard is clunky, but it works...)<br>
			- yt-dlp for youtube<br>
			- emulators: ????<br>
